Xfields
=======



Xfields is a python package belonging to the Xsuite library for the simulation of beam dynamics in particle accelerators. Xfields allows computing the electromagnetic fields generated by particle ensambles using Particle In Cell (PIC) solvers or simplified distributions.

The implemented physics models are being documented in `this guide <https://github.com/xsuite/xfields/blob/master/docs/physics_manual/physics_man.pdf>`_.

The source code is available in this `GitHub repository <https://github.com/xsuite/xfields/blob/master/docs/physics_manual/physics_man.pdf>`_.
